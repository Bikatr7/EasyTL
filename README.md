## EasyTL

Wrapper for OpenAI, DeepL, and Gemini APIs for easy translation of text.

EasyTL has a trello board:
https://trello.com/b/Td555CoW/easytl

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Quick Start**<a name="quick-start"></a>

To get started with EasyTL, install the package via pip:

```bash
pip install easytl
```

Then, you can translate Japanese text using DeepL by importing the global client.

```python
from easytl import EasyTL

## set your api key
EasyTL.set_api_key("deepL", "your_api_key_here")

## you can also validate your api keys, translation functions will do this automatically
is_valid, e = EasyTL.validate_api_key("deepL")

translated_text = EasyTL.deepl_translate("私は日本語が話せます", "EN") ## Text to translate, language to translate to, only two "required" arguments but there are more optional arguments for additional functionality.

## easytl also has a generic translate method, which defaults to deepl, requires text, and kwargs for the translate method it uses.

translated_text = EasyTL.translate("私は日本語が話せます", target_lang="EN")

## There is also a calculate cost method.
## for deepl, model is deepl
num_characters, cost, model = EasyTL.calculate_cost("私は日本語が話せます", "deepL") ## Text to translate, service to use

## or for llms
## last 2 arguments are optional, defaults to gpt-4 and "Translate to English"
num_tokens, cost, model = EasyTL.calculate_cost("私は日本語が話せます", "openai", "gpt-4", "Translate to English") ## Text to translate, service to use, model to use, prompt to use

```

**Notes**<a name="notes"></a>

EasyTL was originally developed as a part of [Kudasai](https://github.com/Bikatr7/Kudasai), a Japanese preprocessor later turned Machine Translator. It was later split off into its own package to be used independently of Kudasai for multiple reasons.

This package is also my second serious attempt at creating a Python package, so I'm sure there are some things that could be improved. Feedback is welcomed.
